# Introduction

This framework allows managers and directors to have meaningful conversations with engineers about the expectations of each position and how to plan for the next level in their career ladder at Layr. It may be easy to conclude that the Layr Engineering Ladders represent a structural hierarchy. It is more beneficial to imagine an inverse triangle where the engineers who are producing software related things (code, tests, requirements, delivery models) are supported by directors and managers who are producing plans for leveling up engineers.

Although the framework uses roles and levels that are somewhat standard in the US tech industry, every company is different. The roles described in this repository are specific to Layr and the needs of Layr end customers, internal users, and other stakeholders. Our mission is to create the very best technology enabled experience possible for our those that use our software.

We expect that the Layr Engineering Ladders will change over time as the landscape of sofrware engineering changes.  We encourage all team members to submit pull requests to make the Layr Engineering Ladders better serve our customers with the very best experience possible. 

The framework relies heavily on radar charts to show visually the different perspectives and expectations of a given position:

  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="charts/template.png">
  <img alt="Template Chart" src="charts/template.png">
</picture>

We designed these charts to represent the progression in the scope of responsibilities, skills, and accountabilities.  As you explore each ladder ask yourself - how can I level up my skills to achieve the next rung in the ladder.  We've provided training and expected telemetry to help you and hope that you contribute to the conversation about what each rung means. 

# Career Ladders

The framework has 5 different ladders, each of which is critical to leveling up team memebers who can help Layr create the best technology enabled experience for our customers.  The first four ladders have two segments - 

* Engineers - Engineers are generally responsible for building software related things, be it software, automated tests, requirements, or project plans. They may mentor colleagues but do not have management or coordination responsibilities.
* Directors - Directors are generally responsible for building people related thing meant to support engineers like suport plans to ensure that they have what they need to quickly build high quality in a team they love and for a mission in which they believe, and career plans to help them continuously upgrade their skills. They have deep experience in being an engineer giving them the empathy they need to deeply understand what the team needs to be effective.

## Software
The primary product of team members on this ladder is high quality software.
* [**Engineer**](Software-Engineer.md): Responsible for quickly building high quality software that meets business requirements, and setting timeline expectations. Often referred to as a developer.   
* [**Director**](Software Director.md): Responsible for helping engineers with architectural decision, technology direction, the system and requires a unique balance between hands-on development, architecture knowledge and production support.  Often referred to as a tech lead.
## Quality
The primary product of team members on this ladder is automated regression tests for UI's and API's. 
* [**Engineer**](Quality-Engineer.md):Responsible for building automated regression tests to ensure that software works as expected and still works after enhancements.
* [**Director**](Quality-Director.md):tbd
## Delivery
The primary product of team members on this ladder is models that can help the team manage their work, monitor their progress, and identify opportunties to streamline work.
* [**Engineer**](Delivery-Engineer.md):tbd
* [**Director**](Delivery-Director.md):tbd
## Product
The primary product of team members on this ladder is high quality software requirements and clear business direction that will result in a great technology enabled experience for our customers. 
* [**Engineer**](Product-Engineer.mdd):tbd
* [**Director**](Product-Director.md):tbd

## [**Engineering Support**](Engineering-Support.md)

This last ladder is meant for team members who spend all of their time producing coaching plans to level up team members to reliably deliver high quality software solutions to our customers. The primary product of team members on this ladder is strategic guidance to directors on career plans that grow skills that are aligned with the company strategy and market needs.

If you are confused about the difference between a [Software Director](Software Director.md) and an [Engineering Support](Engineering-Support.md), please refer to the [Software Directror vs Engineering Support](TechLead-Engineering-Support.md) page for a detailed comparison.

# Axes

The chart shown above has the following 5 axes:
* **Technology**: knowledge of the tech stack and tools
* **System**: level of ownership of the system(s)
* **People**: relationship with the team(s)
* **Process**: level of engagement with engineering process
* **Influence**: social network influence

The **influence** axis can be seen as a *different dimension* since it is orthogonal and applies to all the other axes.

Each axis has 5 different levels of performance. It is important to highlight that every level includes the previous one(s). For example, someone that *evangelizes* technology, *specializes* and *adopts* it as well.

Keep reading to better understand each level.

# Levels
Below are the general skill expectations for each rung in the ladder. These generally apply to all roles.  For each role, however, there are specific training and performance telemetry expectations specified for the role.

## Technology

# FAQs

**What if some of the people don't meet all the points?**
That is very normal, people are usually stronger in some areas and weaker in others. The framework should not be used as a checklist to promote people but instead as guidance to have meaningful career conversations.

**What if I disagree with the Layr Engineering Ladders?**
The Layr Engineering Ladders is open to the entire Layr Engineering team.  We invite all members to submit pull requests to improve it.  Furthermore, the Layr Engineerind Ladders is in a public repository so anyone can help us improve with your perspectives.

**When is a person ready to move to the next level?**
We will measure performance Telemetry through quarterly 360 degree feedback.  We will measure training performance through assessments, certifications, skill demonstrations, etc. To level up your career at Layr your must, at a minimum, meet the training and telemetry expectations for at least one quarter. You must then present your case to the Coaching Team that you have successfully achieved the next scope of your chosen engineering ladder.

**How do I collect evidence to support the discussion with the Coaching team?**
Layr uses Lattice to collect the necessary data :
* 1:1 updates
* 360 degree feedback from peers and other teams
* Quarterly Individual Development Objectives (IDO's) 

In addition to Lattice, Layr also uses tools like LinearB to collect engineering performance.  Finally, we closely monitor team burn-down charts and individual contributions to the burndown. 

**Could the framework provide more specific examples of behavior to support each level?**
Specific examples of behavior require knowledge about the way that the team works, the system architecture and its technology stack. It is recommended to allow each team to define their own examples for each role.

**Why do all the software ladders except for software stop at level 4?**
Software engineering has many more dimensions than the other roles including programming language, front-end versus backend, cloud experience, architectural paradigms, etc.  Climbing the software ladders typically requires a masters degree and a number of certifications, all of which are difficult to achieve,  This is not to say that the other roles are not as critical to a great customer experience; it is to say that ultimately it is the software engineer's output that the customer will touch directly.

**Why does the framework stop at level 7?**
Levels 8 and above vary drastically from company to company. Organizations of different sizes tend to assign a diverse level of scope to positions so high in their structure.  At our current size, we've determined that 7 levels is more that enough to meet the needs of Layr's customers.
