# Software Director vs Engineering Director

It is very common for companies to mix the Softeare Director and Engineering Director roles. Although both roles have some overlap, their focus is different: the Software Director is primarily focused on creating high quality software while the Enginerering Director is primarily focused on creating high quality teams.

If the team is small and/or the Software Director has a lot of experience as an Engineering Director, the same person might perform both roles. However, these responsibilities are often at odds and it is very difficult to do both well.  This problems amplifies as the system and team grow in size and complexity and there often comes a breaking point where one area of focus will typically suffer in service to the other (typically the people take second priority to the software).

The following is a non-exhaustive list that exemplifies some of the different responsibilities of each role:

| [Software Director](Software-Director.md) (System) | [Engineering Director](Engineering-Director.md) (People)|
| :--- | :--- |
| Technical Excellence and Innovation| Career Planning and Coaching |
| Architecture and System Integration | Headcount Planning and Hiring |
| Tech Mentoring, Adoption and Alignment | Team Planning and Delivery |
| Technical Spikes and Experiments​ | Objectives, Performance and Feedback |
| Code Reviews and Feedback | Providing guidance on 1:1's |
| System Design Presentations​ | Participation in Technical Decisions |
| Technical Capacity Planning​ | Cascading Communications​ |
| Production Issues Escalation​ | Team Building Activities and Culture​ |
| System SLAs, Metrics & Monitoring​ | Team Protection and Happiness​ |
| Platform Direction, Patterns and Practices | Team Productivity and Metrics​ |
| Alignment with other Software Directors​ | Alignment with other Dev Managers​ |
| Hands-On Coding 30% to 70% of the Time | Hands-On Coding 0% to 30% of the Time |
| System Roadmap (shared)​ | System Roadmap (shared)​ |
| Development Process (shared)​ | Development Process (shared)​ |
| Team Visibility and Recognition (shared) | Team Visibility and Recognition (shared)​ |
| Ability to Act as Enginerering Director when Required | Ability to Act as Software Director when Required |

The last point on each role highlights the fact that the lists are not mutually exclusive, and therefore many of the points from one side are also important on the other side too. An Enginerering Director that can't understand the technical challenges that the team is facing won't be successful at the role, the same is true for a Software Director that doesn't understand the career paths of the engineers in the team. 

Having said that, although it is important for an Enginerering Director to be able act as a Software Director and vice versa, it also critical for them to focus and excel at the right things. Although there is a clear overlap and an opportunity for collaboration, both positions must know well who is responsible for what to avoid conflicts and misunderstandings.
