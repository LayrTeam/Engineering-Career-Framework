# Progress & Promotions

A key benefit of working with the Layr Engineering team is our commitment to each team member that we will work with them to level up their skills to help them become more valuable for our customers and in their careers. Each dimension level has expected training and certifications necessary to operate at that level. Each team member must decide, with support from directors, how to best use their time to complete the training and pass certificate exams.

On a quarterly basis, each director will review the feedback and quarterly progress for each engineer in system they support.  Engineering Directors will review the feedback and progress for all of the directors.  Thje directors will then meet as a team quarterly to discuss holstic improvements (e.g., communication, cultural, moralle, etc). This is also an opportunity to discuss individuals if warranted (e.g.,potential promotions, reassignments, and even terminations).

Each director will then be responsible for working with the engineers or directors they support to come up with the next step in their career plan, called an Individual Development Objective, or IDO. This step may be informed by the training and certifications for the next level in a dimension or it could be something else that that can help the team member expand their scope of impact.  The IDO should ideally be something that the team member can complete in a quarter or, at the very least, make regular weekly progress throughout the quarter.

Once everyone agrees to the IDO, it must be entered into Lattice as an objective and aligned with the company strategy.  Next, someone must be assigned as a mentor for the quarter. Often times, this is a director, but it doesn't have to be. Anyone with [mentoring](README.md#people) skills (or higher) could be a mentor. Sometimes it may make more sense to delegate mentoring because - 
* Another person may have just done something similar
* There are too many engineers and not enough directors
* An Engineer has expressed a desire to become a director and is looking for practice

Once the team member -
* Meets all of the performance expectations for the next step in their career
* Completes all of the training and certifications for all of the levels necessary for the next step

They may submit a petition to the their director for a promotion with all of the evidence from Lattice.  The promotion will be discussed at the next quarterly coaching meeting.  If the team unanimously agrees to the promotion, we will change the team member's designation to recognize their increased level of contribution to our customers.  Pay increases occur
